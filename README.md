Hi there!

## My ✨TOP 3✨ favourite languages
- 1: Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Extends Javascript with a type system
- 2: Java (https://www.java.com/en/) It's just Java man! ☕
- 3: NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) Run Javascript on a server

## My favourite projects
- 1: NextJS (https://nextjs.org/) Create amazing, SEO friendly React web apps with ease
- 2: React (https://reactjs.org/) "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces". Some people say it's sloooooooow. However normally you won't notice any big difference.
- 3: Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/) An developer friendly, no SQL database and much more. 
- 4: SolidJS (https://github.com/solidjs/solid) Feels like react but *faster*.
- 5: lui (https://github.com/L3P3/lui) Very tiny web framework in the style of react.
- 5: Gradle (https://gradle.org/) A fast Java Build tool 
- 6: ACF (https://github.com/aikar/commands) A bit more Minecraft specific, however really handy! It allows you to create Minecraft plugin commands with annotations.

## Languages that I can speak

- a little bit of French
